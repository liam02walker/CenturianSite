          <h2>What Is ARS Bellica MMA?</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            ARS Bellica has been created by Adam Jones, who has studied Martial Arts for 20 years, which includes the effective ctiteria to be able to defend
            yourself in any life threatening situation. Students as a Black Belt, which in ARS Bellica is the first belt a student can achieve, will be able to
            properly defend themselves. ARS Bellica is a Latin word that means Art Of War and it will be Britain's first recognised Martial Arts as the Romans
            created the systems that led to the development of Great Britain. Mastering ARS Bellica will take time and true dedication from every single person,
            but in the end will benefit each student greatly as they will understand how to work on the ground and on their feet.
          </p>
          <h3>MMA Styles</h3>
          <p>
            ARS Bellica is composed of 10 different MMA Styles, carefully selected by Adam Jones over 20 years of Martial Arts experience. Each has been picked for
            one reason only, to master self defence.
          </p>
          <p>
            These 10 MMA Styles are:

          <h3>Grading System</h3>
          <p>
            In ARS Bellica each student will work towards the Black Belt, which will be the first Belt as it symbolises darkness. Your journey to the next belts will be a journey
            of finding enlightenment through repetition and hard work. People should be tested to get the absolute best out of them and that is why we will follow this grading
            system.
